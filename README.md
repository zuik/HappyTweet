# HappyTweet
HackBeanpot Project

Ever wonder how happy you sound to others on Twitter? Or how sad? Or angry? Well, now you can use this Jackie Robinson
Beanie Babies project to find out!
You'll also be able to tell how other local Twitter users sound through their tweets, as well!

from nearby accounts and calculates the appropriate emotion for the text using the Indico API.
